Sangabc converted the model to MMD



Please NOTE:
-Sometimes Hood Pass through hair! It is easy to fix but it make physics look not good 
-Even though the model may seen to have unnecessary joints and physics dont delete em they help physics
-All shader were made from AlternativeFull so credit to them, except the soft shader, i have no idea who made them but credit to them too!
-The file contain the original model, no armor break.
-Only toon and spa are owned by me.
-The Weapon size isnt the official size
